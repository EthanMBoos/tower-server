```

**Key insight:** Every device has a regular IP address (`192.168.1.x`), but Tower uses **multicast** — a special addressing scheme where messages go to a *group*, not a specific device.

## What is Multicast?

Think of it like radio channels:

| Concept | Radio Analogy | Network Equivalent |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Unicast** | Phone call (one-to-one) | Send to `192.168.1.50` |
| **Broadcast** | PA system (one-to-all) | Send to `192.168.1.255` |
| **Multicast** | Radio station (one-to-subscribers) | Send to `239.255.0.1` |

With multicast:
- Senders publish to a **group address** (e.g., `239.255.0.1`)
- Receivers **subscribe** to groups they care about
- Network hardware delivers packets only to subscribers

## How Tower Uses Multicast

| Direction | Group Address | Port | Who Joins | Who Sends |
|-----------|---------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Vehicle → Server | `239.255.0.1` | `14550` | Server | Vehicles |
| Server → Vehicles | `239.255.0.2` | `14551` | Vehicles | Server |

## Why Multicast Addresses Look Weird

Multicast addresses are **not device addresses** — they're group identifiers.

The range `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255` is reserved at the protocol level (IPv4, RFC 1112). When network hardware sees a destination in this range, it knows to:

1. Use IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) to track subscribers
2. Replicate packets to all subscribers
3. Map to a special Ethernet MAC address (`01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx`)

**You cannot assign a multicast address to a device.** Trying to set your NIC to `239.255.0.1` will fail.

---

## Practical Setup

### What You Need

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Same subnet | All devices on `192.168.1.x/24` (or whatever your network uses) |
| Layer 2 connectivity | All devices reachable at the switch/WiFi level |
| UDP ports open | `14550` and `14551` not blocked by firewalls |
| Multicast-capable NICs | All modern network adapters support this |

### Ground Station Setup

```bash
# Start the server (joins multicast group automatically)
go run ./cmd/tower-server

# Or with explicit sources
TOWER_MCAST_SOURCES="239.255.0.1:14550" ./server
```

The server calls `IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` under the hood — this tells your NIC "deliver packets for `239.255.0.1` to me."

### Robot Setup (Firmware Side)

Your vehicle firmware needs to:

```python
# Python example (robot side)
import socket
import struct

# --- SENDING TELEMETRY ---
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
# Send to multicast group (NOT the server's IP!)
sock.sendto(telemetry_bytes, ("239.255.0.1", 14550))

# --- RECEIVING COMMANDS ---
cmd_sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
cmd_sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
cmd_sock.bind(("", 14551))

# Join multicast group
mreq = struct.pack("4sl", socket.inet_aton("239.255.0.2"), socket.INADDR_ANY)
cmd_sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, mreq)

# Now cmd_sock.recv() will get commands from server
```

---

## Testing Locally (No Hardware)

Tower includes a test sender that simulates vehicles on your development machine:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
go run ./cmd/tower-server

# Terminal 2: Simulate a vehicle
go run ./cmd/testsender -vid ugv-husky-01

# Terminal 3: Simulate another vehicle
go run ./cmd/testsender -vid usv-blueboat-02 -env marine
```

This works because multicast loopback is enabled — your machine receives its own multicast packets.

---

## Multiple Multicast Groups

If different vehicle types use different groups (e.g., UGVs on `239.255.0.1`, USVs on `239.255.1.1`):

```bash
# Server joins both groups
TOWER_MCAST_SOURCES="239.255.0.1:14550:ugv,239.255.1.1:14550:usv" ./server
```

Each robot broadcasts to its designated group. The server listens to all.

---

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Server doesn't see packets | Firewall blocking UDP | `sudo ufw allow 14550/udp` |
| Works on laptop, fails on Pi | Multiple NICs, joined wrong one | The server joins on all interfaces by default |
| WiFi doesn't work | AP blocks multicast | Enable multicast forwarding on access point |
| Works locally, not across machines | Different subnets | Move to same subnet, or configure multicast routing |
| Intermittent packet loss | WiFi multicast rate limiting | Some APs throttle multicast; use wired or tune AP settings |

### Debugging with tcpdump

```bash
# See multicast traffic on the telemetry group
sudo tcpdump -i any host 239.255.0.1 and udp port 14550

# See all multicast traffic
sudo tcpdump -i any 'ip multicast'
```

## Comparison: Multicast vs Alternatives

### Option 1: Unicast (Point-to-Point)

```
    Vehicle A ────────────▶ Server
    Vehicle B ────────────▶ Server  
    Vehicle C ────────────▶ Server
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Simple to understand | Server IP must be known/configured on each vehicle |
| Works across subnets | Adding vehicles requires config on vehicle side |
| Firewall-friendly | Commands must be sent to each vehicle individually |

**When to use:** Internet-connected fleets, NAT traversal needed, or multicast-hostile networks.

### Option 2: Broadcast

```
    Vehicle A ────┐
    Vehicle B ────┼───▶ 192.168.1.255 (everyone on subnet)
    Vehicle C ────┘
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Zero config | ALL devices receive ALL packets (wasteful) |
| Simple | Doesn't cross subnets |
| | Scales poorly (network flooded) |

**When to use:** Rarely. Multicast is almost always better.

### Option 3: Multicast (Tower's Choice)

```
    Vehicle A ────┐
    Vehicle B ────┼───▶ 239.255.0.1 (only subscribers receive)
    Vehicle C ────┘
              Server subscribes
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Zero-config discovery | Doesn't route across subnets by default |
| Efficient (only subscribers get packets) | Some WiFi APs handle it poorly |
| Scales well | Slightly harder to debug |
| Commands reach all vehicles with one send | |

**When to use:** Field deployments on a local network (exactly what Tower targets).

### Option 4: Message Broker (MQTT, ROS2 DDS)

```
    Vehicle A ────┐            ┌───▶ Server
    Vehicle B ────┼───▶ Broker ┼───▶ Logger
    Vehicle C ────┘            └───▶ Cloud
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Decoupled pub/sub | Extra infrastructure (broker) |
| Works across networks | Latency from broker hop |
| Persistence, QoS, auth | Complexity |
| Multiple consumers easy | |

**When to use:** Complex multi-system architectures, cloud integration, long-term data logging.

## Summary

| Concept | Tower Value |
|---------|--------------|
| Telemetry group | `239.255.0.1:14550` |
| Command group | `239.255.0.2:14551` |
| Device IPs | Normal unicast (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) — not directly used by protocol |
| Transport | UDP (fast, tolerates loss) |
| Requirement | All devices on same Layer 2 network |

**The key mental model:** Vehicles don't send to the server's IP. They send to a *group*, and the server subscribes to that group. This is why you don't need to configure server addresses on robots — they just broadcast to the well-known group.
